| :white_check_mark:    | [Scalability! But at what COST?](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos15/hotos15-paper-mcsherry.pdf)    | Was a nice reminder that not all problems scale well when their nature makes them less paralisable. Even for problems that are suited, COST appears to be a good thing to keep in mind to determine if a system can overcome the distribution overhead to be faster than a single node.  |
